# Get-Rocked
Get-Rocked is a text-based game played solely in the console window.

Description:
You play as a kid on the playground on a snowy day. Your objective is to collect snowballs and defeat as many playground enemies as possible before you yourself are defeated.
These enemies are other kids on the playground also looking to smack some kids with snowballs so be ready!
Occassionally, you'll because to gather enough snow to create a Super Snowball. These do double damage! But will upset the kid's parent and they will intervene to try to teach you a lesson about playing too rough.
How dare they try to make you learn outside of school! Snowball them too! (They're worth double points).
